ukraine makes gains in its other war  fighting corruption
ukraine has battled endemic corruption since the first days of its independence in 1991 and government officials and independent campaigners alike say that fight is key to winning the existential war it is fighting with russia
they have had some success anticorruption organisation transparency international ranks ukraine at its highest level since 2006 currently 104th out of 180 countries in its corruption perceptions index
most ukrainian anticorruption institutions are showing pretty good results andriy borovyk the executive director of transparency international ukraine tells the bbc
according to him one such result is the arrest of the thensupreme court head vsevolod knyazev on bribery charges in may 2023
this can be a safeguard because if you see somebody arrested you will think twice before doing something corrupt he said
there have been other highprofile arrests too including agriculture minister mykola solsky and an officer with the sbu intelligence service artem shylo
all three deny any wrongdoing and have been released on bail investigations are ongoing
a key milestone came in 2015 when a digital platform called prozorro helped slash corruption in government procurement saving ukraine almost 6 billion £47bn in public funds in just four years
ukraine’s task now is to focus on rooting out corruption in its tax and customs services as well as improve financial oversight says mr borovyk
"a lot of money is coming to ukraine from the west and of course they are asking whether there is proper control over this money” he adds
in addition to sapping ukraines meagre resources corruption has in recent years hampered the flow of foreign aid donald trump cited corruption concerns when challenged about delaying assistance to ukraine when he was us president
corruption has also been a major obstacle to recruiting more men for the war with russia last year president volodymyr zelensky sacked all regional officials in charge of military conscription amid bribery concerns thousands of ukrainians also bribed their way out of the country to avoid being sent to the war

better at doing our job

andriy synyuk deputy head of the specialised anticorruption prosecution service argues that frequent reports of ukrainian officials being accused of corruption are a welcome sign
this doesn’t mean that more crimes are being committed this means that weve become better at doing our job he says"
there arent any people or positions left in ukraine that anticorruption agencies cannot touch he tells the bbc this is probably our main achievement because we couldnt even dream of it a few years ago
dmytro kalmykov the head of the anticorruption policy department at the national agency for preventing corruption a government agency says graft has been all but exterminated in some of the worst affected areas  for instance government services such as issuing passports permits and licences
he also tells the bbc that significant progress had been made in reforming education and police
problem areas
mr kalmykov admits however that the government has been less successful in eradicating corruption in using natural resources eg in mining and forestry regulating monopolies and in large infrastructure projects
progress has been slowest where big interests and big players meet he says
according to him in the next fiveten years the government should focus on cleansing the judiciary which will make the general system of public administration healthier
anticorruption campaigners agree that the ukrainian government has become much more active in fighting corruption
something clicked in their heads last winter their attitude has really changed importantly it did at the very top says prominent ukrainian anticorruption journalist yuri nikolov
perhaps they realised things were going pearshaped or the government in kyiv may have come under pressure from western donors mr nikolov tells the bbc
the fact is he goes on lawenforcement have stepped up their game
demand for change
so what is driving ukraines anticorruption push
vitaly shabunin board chairman of the anticorruption action centre a ukrainian ngo believes it is a combination of pressure from the ukrainian public and foreign donors
regardless of whether or not the government wants to fight corruption and regardless of who is in the government public pressure and the effectiveness of civil society and media means than no government can ignore corruption he says
as an example he mentions a reshuffle of ukraine’s government in 2023 which followed allegations of defence officials procuring food supplies for the ukrainian army at inflated prices
the scandal launched institutional changes in defence procurement which means that there will be no corruption there even after the minister changes he tells the bbc corruption scandals may force state institutions to change for the better
mr shabunin dismisses concerns that western military assistance to ukraine can be embezzled all weapons supplied by western allies end up in the hands of ukrainian troops who use them effectively it is impossible to steal western weapons
but experts say the ukrainian government needs to do more to stamp out corruption this is particularly important at a time of war mr nikolov says
corruption is killing us if you want to be left without any ammunition at all if you want to be left without money to buy ammunition with if you want to welcome occupiers to kyiv then yes turn a blind eye to corruption but trust me the first thing theyll do once were occupied is theyll shoot us all thats why fighting corruption is a matter of survival
